## Getting Started
[Click here]() to get in touch with me about a sneaker bot!

## Future Enhancements
In the future I would like to make it so that you can click on the appointments and edit them to make them pending, recieved and finished. Also would like to add authorization so that you can only see the forms that the user makes and the admin can see all of them.
